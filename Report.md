## PROBLEM

### Abstract

When the problem was presented to us, we were asked to build an application
that assists field scouts to document innovative practices from the grassroot
level across rural and urban India.

### Road to Problem Definition

Upon Sanshodh (‘research’ in Gujarati), we could understand and map the
whole process through which each innovation documentation goes.
We spoke to Senior Innovation Fellow, Dr. Kanti Patel, at NIF about
their current methodologies to document and collect data. The team was
introduced to other parties involved in the process such as the
VARD(Value Addition, Research and Development) Team and the PAS(Prior
Art Search) Team. A few team members visited Manu Bhai, who works at a Mango Orchard
around the Grambharti Campus. There, the team had a first-hand
experience the first-time innovative practice documentation process.

### The Final Problem Definition

After intensive debates, deliberations, use-case diagrams, and concept
mapping, the team collectively framed the following problem definition.
```
To build an application with a robust backend framework and simplistic
interface that can handle, process, and export a considerable load of incoming
data including pictures, video, or even audio files that conform to the
current data collection and processing methodologies at SRISTI/NIF.
```

## ROADBLOCKS

Once the problem was identified, we could not wait to start working on our
application. However, we had to face major roadblocks before we could even
think of starting to work. Quite frankly, none of us had ever worked on
building a software of this grandeur. Also, we had very little exposure to
professional app building and software development lifecycles. In a sea of
information on the Internet, we did not know what to look for. Neither any
ideas for tools or kits, nor any background for collaborative development.
```
Water, water, everywhere,
And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, everywhere,
Nor any drop to drink.
```
## LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL

While attending a Skype interaction with Ted Moallem, the ‘App Team’
(what we and everyone else called ourselves then) stretched at the back
feeling out of place as every other group posed their practical challenges
they were facing to Ted. Ted listened to each one of them patiently and
responded with his insight and understanding. The ‘App Team’ so-far thought
their only problem was their inadequate and sub-par skill-set.


A team member then suggested to put our problem (shamelessly) in front
of Ted. His response was absolutely motivating and could easily be pointed out
as ​ **‘The Turning Point’** ​ in our journey of crafting a solution. Ted asked us to
look into certain tools and open-source projects that can help us in building
the app we designed. He mentioned that the Telegram API and Open Data Kit
tools could help us in building the project.

## SANSHODH ENDS. SANSHODH BEGINS.

After the interaction with Ted, the team was absolutely motivated to pull this
through. We reworked our research and put concrete ideas on paper. The team
then laid out the structure of the app and based on user-inputs, defined the
user privileges and tools. Once, backed up with research, we realised the
‘Sanshodh’ phase was now over and it was time to materialize our ideas.
Although, we came upon the fact that ‘Sanshodh’ will always remain an
important aspect of our product and our development lifecycle. So, we called
the app, ‘SRISTI Sanshodh Collect’

## APP DEVELOPMENT

### Revving up the CPUs

The team moved from their abode in Grambharti to the NIF Office in Ahmedabad
to get better connectivity to the Internet and other local experts in App
Building. The team met with Mr. Hemant who is a professional App Developer in
Ahmedabad. Mr. Hemant introduced the team to collaboration tools like GitHub
and BitBucket. The team then created a public repository on GitHub under an
Apache 2.0 License to start writing some code. One of the team members read up
thoroughly on the ODK (Open Data Kit) Documentation that Ted had mentioned of
to check if there is any scope of help.

### Setting up environments

Before starting to collaborate on a single project, it was absolutely
necessary to setup the exact same development environment on each of our
systems. We upgraded our Android Studio (Desktop Application to help build and
organise Android Development) and installed the same on systems that did not
have it before.


### Open Data Kit breakthrough

One of our colleagues realised that Open Data Kit could actually serve as a
solid framework for our app and that we can tweak its powerful tools a little
to exactly suit our needs. The team was then clear that the App should be
built around an ODK framework.

### Software Requirements Specification Submission

Once we got our hands on ODK, we had the tools we needed. Now, we deliberated
and discussed what modules our system can have that can be carved out with
these tools. A preliminary but exhaustive SRS was sent to Sagar Bhai for
approval from the team at SRISTI.

### Coding Right is Coding Overnight

Over the next two days, the team worked pretty much day and night in shifts to
bring out a somewhat stable build of the application that could carry out the
basic requirements, something like a prototype solution to our problem. We
also built for ourselves a robust backend on Google Cloud Platform to export
and visualize the data.

### Version Handling

In an attempt to relate our version builds to the app-use environment, we
decided that we could name our versions on some of the crops that are
cultivated. Analogous to how Google names Android Versions over desserts. Our
first build that we released on May 30, 2018 was called the ‘areca’ build. We
are still working on the master branch and plan on releasing a much more
stable and upgraded ‘barley’ build before the end of Summer School.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

In our pursuit of social innovation and bring together information technology
to make innovation documentations indexable, accessible, and expedited, we
could never have achieved our product had it not been for the interactions and
insights from the wonderful inspirers mentioned below.

### Prof. Anil Gupta

We thank Prof. Gupta for the constant motivation and support for innovative
ideas. His idea of inclusive development has kept inspiring us throughout our
time here at Summer School.

### Dr. Ted Moallem

Dr. Moallem or simply Ted (like he prefers) is the saviour to our project. Ted
brought to us the right ideas at the right time and showed us the right path.
We thank Ted for his invaluable insight during our Skype interaction. Our
project would have, honestly, never taken off without his inputs and advice.

### Dr. Kanti Patel

Dr. Kanti provided us with the insight into the exhaustive working methodology
and innovation documentation lifecycle at NIF. We thank him for taking out
time and also connecting us to his peers for an expert review of our app.

### Sagar Panchal

Sagar Bhai has been a constant support throughout our Summer School journey.
He has spearheaded the mammoth task of managing everyone and despite that,
taking out time to provide us with contacts and inputs during the process.

### Akshay - NIF, Ahmedabad

We extend our gratitude to Mr. Akshay at NIF, Ahmedabad Office for hosting us
for an entire week at his office. Mr. Akshay took it upon himself to make sure
that nothing falls in line to the success of our project.
Apart from the names above, we owe immense thanks to every other staff from
SRISTI, NIF and Grambharti who have worked to make Summer School possible.
